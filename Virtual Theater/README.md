# Virtual Theater 
** Created in Unity **

- This directory only contains the scripts written for the project, not the assets or materials used.
- This project follows multiple Virtual Reality tips and tricks I learned in my VR class.
- The Theater is meant to be used with a Virtual Reality system however because I do not own one myself, it is not optimized for it.
